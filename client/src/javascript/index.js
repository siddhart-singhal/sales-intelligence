                <h1>Sales Intelligence: A Guide to Smart Selling</h1>
                <p>If you asked someone what “sales intelligence” was a decade ago, they’d have mostly likely drawn a blank to your question.
                 Sales intelligence as we know it today simply did not exist back then. While it was a requirement that sales teams of the past were yearning to find a solution for (as they do today), the technology to support the requirement was not easy to build.
                 <br/><br/>
                 Today, thanks to the thriving universe of SaaS products and the technological leaps that we’ve made, sales intelligence is powerful and accessible—enabling sales teams to sell better, faster, and with more insight than ever before.
                 <br/><br/> But what is sales intelligence, really? What are the building blocks that it is made up of, how can it impact your company, and how will it evolve in the future? That’s exactly what we’ll be exploring today. Let’s dive right into it.</p>

                <h2>What is Sales Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>Sales intelligence, in a nutshell, refers to the information and insights that companies can have about their prospective buyers.<br/><br/>
                As a sales representative, manager, or VP, you’d want to have the most up-to-date, relevant, and personalized information about your target account’s users, buyers, and decision-makers. The more information you have about your prospects, the more are your chances of closing the sale, just because of that fact that you were able to accurately determine when they want your product/service and why they should want it.<br/><br/> 
               Sales intelligence helps you find the right kind of prospects for your company, enables you to reach them on the right platform, build a pitch that address their exact pain points, and shorten the time that it takes to close the deal.<br/><br/>
                While that should give you a well-rounded idea of what sales intelligence is, we often find that several other things are often misconstrued as sales intelligence while they really aren’t. Let’s take a closer look at what those are.
